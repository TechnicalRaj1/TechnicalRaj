    <h1> people who are saving the Earth</h1>
    <p>22 April 2016
        , 
        by Rudi Bressa
        Actors, scientists, politicians, activists. All driven by a single purpose: the protection of our Planet and environment. Because we’ve just one Earth.
        
        OCEANS
        There have been many personalities throughout history who have changed the course of events. And on the occasion of Earth Day we’ve made a list of some people who are currently committing in protecting Planet Earth.</p>

            <h3>Joahn Rockstrom</h3>
            <P>He’s scientist and director of the Stockholm Resilience Centre. He’s universally recognised as one of the most qualified sustainability experts. He works as an advisor for many governments globally and, along with his research team, has developed scientific models that allow mankind to benefit from an ever-unstable planet, which is threatened by climate change and resource scarcity. In his latest book “Big World, Small Planet”, he demonstrates how the Anthropocene is the epoch when the Earth’s stability has been altered forever and how to continue to live following a pattern of sustainable development. “We take it for granted, the world that we love—and we’re destroying it so quickly. The light of dawn on the prairie. The silvery flash of fish in a stream. The cry of a hawk over a forest. Everybody has their own idea of the beautiful, and we’ll surely miss it when it’s gone”.</P>

            <h3>Jane Goodall</h3>
            <p>Scientist, ethologist and anthropologist, she devoted her life to the study and protection of primates. She’s recently turned 82 but still travel the world to divulge her immense love for nature. She’s vegetarian and strongly supports organic farming; she never misses the opportunity to promote coexistence, simplicity and pacifism towards nature and human beings. She participated in last year’s COP21 as an ambassador and presented a documentary on the protection of forests. “You cannot get through a single day without having an impact on the world around you. What you do makes a difference, and you have to decide what kind of difference you want to make”.</p>

            <h3>Bill McKibben</h3>
            <p>American environmentalist, he’s one of the founders of 350.org, the first movement that since the late ‘90s stands up against climate change and promotes the reduction of emissions. Not by chance the safe level of CO2 in the atmosphere to avoid the effects of global warming are 350 parts per million. Today we’re at over 400 ppm. He writes for UK newspaper The Guardian and is author of various books including Eaarth: Making a Life on a Tough New Planet. “A green economy is the only economy we can sustain, because if we don’t respect planetary boundaries to bring the economy forward, there simply won’t be an economy in the future”.</p>
